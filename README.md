## 🌍 Project Overview  
Healthcare today still relies heavily on **paper-based prescriptions**. Patients miss doses, doctors lack visibility into adherence, pharmacists struggle with inventory, and providers face compliance headaches.  

**MediCare Pharmacy CRM** solves these challenges by creating an **end-to-end digital prescription ecosystem** powered by Salesforce.  

From issuing prescriptions to refill management, patient reminders, stock updates, and dashboards — the system ensures **better patient outcomes, streamlined operations, and improved compliance**.

## 🎯 Problem vs. Solution (At a Glance)  

| **Traditional Approach** | **MediCare CRM Approach** |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Paper-based prescriptions 📝 | Digital prescriptions stored securely in Salesforce ☁️ |
| Patients forget refills ❌ | Automated SMS/Email reminders 🔔 |
| Doctors can’t track adherence | Real-time adherence logs & dashboards 📊 |
| Manual pharmacy inventory checks | Auto-updated inventory with low-stock alerts 💊 |
| Compliance risks ⚠️ | HIPAA & GDPR-ready Salesforce security 🔐 |

## 💡 Solution (Scenario-Based)  
Meet **John Doe** 👤.  

John visits **Dr. Smith** 🩺 for an infection. Instead of a paper slip, Dr. Smith creates a **digital prescription** inside MediCare Pharmacy CRM.  

✨ What happens next?  
- 🔔 John receives **SMS & Email reminders** to take his medication on time.  
- 💻 John requests a **refill online** through the patient portal.  
- ✅ The request goes to Dr. Smith → approval → pharmacist notified.  
- 📦 Inventory updates **automatically**, with alerts for low stock.  
- 📊 Dashboards show doctors adherence rates, pharmacists stock health, and admins compliance data.  

👉 No missed doses. No lost prescriptions. No stockouts. Full visibility.
